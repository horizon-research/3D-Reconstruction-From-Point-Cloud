# 3D Reconstruction From Point Cloud using Point-based Detail Transfer

This project builds a 3D reconstruction system from massive point cloud targetting mobile VR rendering. The defining feature of our project is to enable a highly efficient reconstruction workflow that significantly lowers the barrier to entry for reconstructing from huge point clouds (billions of points) while at the same time generating 3D models that are visually pleasing and can be rendered in real time (60 FPS) on today's mobile VR devices, e.g., Oculus Go.

While our system is general, we evaluate it by reconstructing [Elmina Castle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elmina_Castle), a UNESCO world heritage site in Ghana and is of historical and archaeological significance. The datasets are collected in several field trips to Ghana over a span of three years, and will be made public after paper acceptance.
