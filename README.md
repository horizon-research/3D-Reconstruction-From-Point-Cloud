# 3D-Reconstruction-From-Point-Cloud

## Reconstruct Mesh from Point Cloud (Last updated: MeshLab v2016.12)

1. Open [MeshLab](https://www.meshlab.net)

2. Goto ```File -> Import Mesh...``` and select your input **point cloud file**

3. Goto ```Filters -> Point Set -> Compute normals for point sets```. This is required for Screened Poisson Reconstruction

4. Goto ```Filters -> Remeshing, Simplification and Reconstruction -> Screened Poisson Surface Reconstruction```

   1. You can adjust *Reconstruction Depth* to obtain meshes of different resolution (triangle count). The deeper the reconstruction depth is, the higher the resolution.
   
   2. We used *Depth = 8* for low resolution and *Depth = 10* for high resolution

5. In project window (by default is on top right of the window), select *Poisson mesh*, goto ```File -> Export Mesh As...``` to save the reconstructed mesh

   1. in *Choose saving options* window, check *Color*, *Normal* for *Vert* , and uncheck *Binary encoding* for *Additional parameters*


## Color Transfer from High Resolution Mesh using Blender (Last updated v2.79b, using defualt layout)

1. Open [Blender](https://www.blender.org)

2. Press *Esc* to dismiss the launch screen and press *Delete* (macOS: *fn + delete*) to remove the default cube

3. Use ```File -> Import -> Stanford (.ply)``` to import both high and low resolution meshes. Note: files can only be opened one by one

4. Select (on top right of the window) the low resolution mesh

5. Click *Object Mode* (on buttom left of the view) and switch to *Edit Mode*

6. Select *Shading/UVs* (on the left side), under *UV Mapping*, select *Smart UV Project* and click OK

7. Open a new image view

   1. Goto the top right corner of the 3D view and drag left to create a new area
   
   2. On buttom left of the view, click *Object Mode* and switch to *UV/Image Editor*

8. On the bottm of the view, click *New* and set the *Width* and *Height* to 8192px

9. Select the high resolution mesh, then, while holding *shift*, select the low resolution mesh

10. While in *Edit Mode*, goto *Properties Editor* (buttom right of the window), select *Render* (camera icon), and find *Bake*.

    1. Change *Bake Mode* to *Vertex Color*.
   
    2. Check *Selected to Active*.
    
    3. Hit *Bake*
    
    4. After baking is done, at bottom of image view, goto ```Image -> Save As Image```
    
11. Select low resolution mesh and goto ```File -> Export -> Stanford (.ply)```. In *Export PLY*, check *UVs*, then click *Export PLY* to save the low resolution mesh with its UVs.

## Direct Color Transfer from Point Cloud

### Compiling ```pointsTransfer.cpp``` with CmakeList (in ```C++/```)

#### Step 1: Create cmake files

##### Option 1: Use CCMake

```ccmake .``` 

Then you get empty cache page to modify settings.

Press C to configure ==> set: **CGAL_DIR** (the path to CGAL Library, for example, /Users/ting/PointCloud/CGAL-5.0),   **CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE** (RELEASE)

Note: press enter to modify an option, and press enter to save an option

Press C to configure ==> set  **boost_DIR** (/usr/local/Cellar/boost@1.60/1.60.0/include)

If no errors, press G to generate, then press Q to quit

##### Option 2: Use CMake

```cmake .```

#### Step 2: Compile

```make```

#### Step 3: Run! 

```./pointsTransfer <input-point-cloud> <input-triangular-mesh>```

The output would be ```texture.png``` under ```C++/```
